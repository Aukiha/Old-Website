# Website
My shitty personal website written with PHP(for the backgrounds),HTML and CSS.

PHP rolls for a number between 1 and 50 and sets the background to that .jpg file in the Backgrounds folder.

Devices page was written with thebitstick's Devices - https://git.thebitstick.xyz/thebitstick/Devices
